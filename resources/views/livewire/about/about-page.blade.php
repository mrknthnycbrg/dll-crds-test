                    The College Research and Development Services (CRDS) at Dalubhasaan ng Lungsod ng Lucena provides a
                    broad range of research support and resources for faculty, staff, and students under the leadership
                    of the Research Director, Dr. Florian E. Manzanilla. Managed through the DLL-Research Council with
                    committee representatives across academic disciplines, the CRDS strengthens the research culture and
                    productivity of the institution.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Several specialized units come under the umbrella of the CRDS. The Statistical Center offers
                    quantitative data analysis services, statistical software access, and research methodology advice
                    for college researchers. This supports both research projects and student theses requiring complex
                    data handling. The Plagiarism Check Service utilizes industry-leading software to screen documents
                    like faculty publications and student submissions to uphold integrity standards. For protection of
                    inventions and copyrightable works, the Intellectual Property Management Office provides assistance
                    with disclosure, patent filing, licensing agreements, and technology transfer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Publication outlets also operate within the CRDS. The Dinsulan Journal publishes peer-reviewed
                    interdisciplinary research papers by students and faculty members, driving knowledge creation.
                    Compilation of case studies, instructional materials, and best practices across degrees is also
                    facilitated through the CRDS, besides maintaining all regulatory research compliance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With a dual focus on developing researchers and research, the CRDS conducts regular training
                    sessions on research skills, collaborates with partners, and promotes community-engaged research.
                    Through annual events like the Pagkilatis Faculty Research Forum and Research Conference for
                    students, the vibrancy of on-campus research is continually strengthened. Guided by excellence and
                    social responsibility, the College R&D Services steers the research culture of Dalubcenian towards
                    meaningful impacts for academia and communities alike under Dr. Manzanilla's leadership.
