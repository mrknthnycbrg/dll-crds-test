                The College Research and Development Services (CRDS) at Dalubhasaan ng Lungsod ng Lucena provides a
                broad range of research support and resources for faculty, staff, and students under the leadership
                of the Research Director,Dr. Florian E. Manzanilla. Managed through the DLL-Research Council with
                committee representatives across academic disciplines, the CRDS strengthens the research culture and
                productivity of the institution.

            <p class="text-base font-light text-gray-700">
                Several specialized units come under the umbrella of the CRDS. The Statistical Center offers
                quantitative data analysis services, statistical software access, and research methodology advice
                for college researchers. This supports both research projects and student theses requiring complex
                data handling. The Plagiarism Check Service utilizes industry-leading software to screen documents
                like faculty publications and student submissions to uphold integrity standards. For protection of
                inventions and copyrightable works, the Intellectual Property Management Office provides assistance
                with disclosure, patent filing, licensing agreements, and technology transfer.

            <p class="text-base font-light text-gray-700">
                Publication outlets also operate within the CRDS. The Dinsulan Journal publishes peer-reviewed
                interdisciplinary research papers by students and faculty members, driving knowledge creation.
                Compilation of case studies, instructional materials, and best practices across degrees is also
                facilitated through the CRDS, besides maintaining all regulatory research compliance.
            </p>
            <p class="text-base font-light text-gray-700">
                With a dual focus on developing researchers and research, the CRDS conducts regular training
                sessions on research skills, collaborates with partners, and promotes community-engaged research.
                Through annual events like the Pagkilatis Faculty Research Forum and Research Conference for
                students, the vibrancy of on-campus research is continually strengthened. Guided by excellence and
                social responsibility, the College R&D Services steers the research culture of Dalubcenian towards
                meaningful impacts for academia and communities alike under Dr. Manzanilla's leadership.
